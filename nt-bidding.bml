#+TITLE: NT Bidding
#+DESCRIPTION: Notrump openings, responses, defences, escapes etc.

* NT Ranges

1N = 14--16 hcp, possibly a 5 card major in 3rd.
(1x)--P--(P)--1NT = 14--16 hcp, protective same
(1x)--P--(P)--2NT = 19--21 hcp
2N = 20--21 hcp, *with* a 5 card major or 6 card minor

2D--2HS--2N = 20--21 hcp, no 5 card major or 6 card minor

(1x)--1N  = 15-17
(1x)--X then free NT bid = 18--20 hcp
(1x)--X then free jump NT bid = 21+ hcp
(2x)--2N = 16-18

* NT Schemes

Blanket approaches to bidding when natural 1NT and 2NT bids made by our side.

- 1NT/2NT opened
- 1NT/2NT overcall
- 1C--1/2X--1N/2N rebid
- 1C--(any)--1/2X--(any)--1N/2N rebid
- 1C--1M--2C--2N
- 1C--1M--2C--2D--2H--3C+
- 1C--1M--2C--3N
- (2x)-2N

Do *not* use blanket NT scheme when:

- NTs are *rebid* after natural suit opening

#CUT minor_suit_enquiry_3s
3S Minor suit enquiry (slam force if < 5--5 in !c!d)
    3N	no 4card minor, passable
		4C	5--5+, GF
		4D	5--5+, Slam interest.
			4NT	Discouraging
		4NT	Quantitative
	4m	4+ cards possible slam interest
		4M	5--5+ cue bid
		4NT	RKCB
	4N	Both minors <4 KCs,
		5m	Natural no slam interest
	4HS	4+ of the 6KCs, agrees C/D w/ both minors.
#ENDCUT

1N--
    2C  Stayman.
        2D
            3HS = 5--4 Majors invitational
    2DHS
        3CD = strong GF, slam interest probably
        4C = Gerber
        4NT = Natural limit raise
    2DH  Transfer
            Breaking = natural, to partner's suit with ok hand. Other suit is excitement.
    2S  balanced invite or slam try
        2NT = minimum.
        3x = maximum 4+ card suit.
    2NT/3C  transfer pre-empt or invite or slam try in !c or !d with 6+ card suit
    3DH  transfer pre-empt or slam try in !h or !s with 6+ card suit
        3HS = relay
        4X = cue bid
    #PASTE minor_suit_enquiry_3s \F=S
    4C  Gerber
    4D  Nothing
    4HS/5CD to play
    4N quantitative small slam try
    5N quantitative grand slam try

2N--
    3C   4 card Stayman
    3DH	 Transfer
    #PASTE minor_suit_enquiry_3s \F=S
    3N	 S/O
    4C	 Gerber
    4D	 not used
    4HS  play
    4N   Quantitative

* NT Defence

Competing over 1NT. More aggressive when opponents are NonVulnerable.

- Whether with/without interference from opener/responder, new suits shows some SUPP. E.G. (1N)--2H--2S = double fit to some extent.
- Raise mostly competitive, bid game w/ good max.
- X is *penalty* against *non-strong NT*
- X is *takeout* against *Strong NT*, some shape with *4--5 spades*, 12+ HCP
- *4th* sitting under X is *always takeout* with *4--5 spades*, 12+ HCP
- Note, X as T/O could also be played at Matchpoints, but need a strength bid for IMPs vs weak notrumps so donâ€™t miss game

(1N)--
2C = playable in three suits including !c, (not !s when X=takeout)
    2NT = bid again
2D = both majors 4--4+
	2NT = bid again
2HS = natural
    3HS = competitive raise, bid game with good max
2N = minors takeout
3CD = natural intermediate
3HS = pre-empt
3N = both majors, GF

** When opponents run from 1N doubled

- Lebensohl is on -- 2 bids are to play
- X of a natural suit by doubler's partner is 2--3 trumps. Can pass with 4 trumps, or wait for re-opening double.
- Doubler's partner maybe passing with penalty interest (after a future re-opening X) or weak hand that wants to escape
  with both majors -- expecting a re-opening double.
- Another double from the penalty doubler is re-opening.
- Note, maybe better to play X of a Major by doubler's partner as takeout, but another memory strain.


* NT Interference and Lebensohl

Lebensohl is played in a number of blanket NT and other places where the idea is relevant.
Most important is its use against weak twos and after we have made natural opening strength
(or better) 1NT bids.

1. 1NT--(Overcall)
2. (1X)--1NT Overcall by us including Protective -- (bid over)
3. (1NT)--X--(Escape/ XX/ P)
4. (1NT)--X--(transfer) (also considered running from 1N)
5. (Weak 2)--X.
6. (2!c/2!d) Precision/ limited two bid then -- X
7. (1X)--X--(2X).
8. Weak Strong club interference defence.
9. (2D)--P--(2HS)--X (pass or correct)
10. 1NT--(X) when X is for *takeout*

Classic Lebensohl:

- Going via 2NT shows the *weaker* hand (instead of slow shows strong hand)
- Cue bid asks for (denies) a stop and is GF
- Direct cue bid used to show a 4card other major
- Slow cue bid via 2NT denies a 4card other major
- Slow 3N via 2NT denies a 4 card other major, and promises a stop
- 3N direct denies a 4 card other major, and promises a stop
- If a suit is available at the 2 level, then 2x is competitive, 2N--3x invitational, 3x GF

* NT Escape

Escaping from 1N penalty doubled. XX of a takeout double is natural!

1N--(X)
XX = relay to 2C
    2C
        P = clubs escape 5+ suite
        2DH = natural 5+ suit
        2S = same as direct 2S (or play as extra weak)
    2C = !c + !s
    2D = !d + !s
    2H = !h + !s
    2S = natural
