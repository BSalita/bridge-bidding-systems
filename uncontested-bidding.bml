* 1D Opening

Short / Nebulous !d for flattish or 3 suited or both minors or extreme shape maximum 6+!d and 5!h/!s hands.

- Zero plus !d cards
- 11--(13) balanced/semi-balanced hands with 2+ card !d suit (poor vulnerable 11 hcp flat may pass)
- 11--(13) balanced hands in principle do not include any 5 card major hands
- 11--15 unbalanced 3 suiter (4--4--4--1 / 5--4--4--0 / 5--4--3--1) any short suit and without a 5 card major, so maybe minor canapé
- 11--15 both minors 5--4 / 5--5 (6--5 maximum could also use for more space), so maybe minor canapé.
- Rare extreme shape hands with extras include 6(7)!d--5!h/!s

Other bids:

- Often open [2!c](#2C Intermediate Opening)/[2!d](#2D Intermediate Opening) with minimum 6--5 both minors and 2!c with 6--6 minor hands
- A maximum 6--5 minors can be supported by 1!d or the 2!c/2!d openings, experiment
- Open [2!d](#2D Intermediate Opening) with a 7!d--4!h/!s hand
- Improvise with 8!d--4!h/!s, probably best to open higher with 2!d expecting competition. It's a very rare 1:2211 frequency anyway.
- [Open 1!c](#1C Weak Strong) with any good 13--15 weak NT like hand, including many 5--4--2--2 five card !c/!d hands
- Open [1!h](#1H Opening) or [1!s](#1S Opening) with an 11--(13) hcp 5--3--3--2 major, unless willing to pretend it is a 4 card suit
- Open [1!h](#1H Opening) or [1!s](#1S Opening) with a minimum 6!d and 5 card !h/!s hand and bid like a 5--5 hand

**** Opener's cue bid

When partner bids 1!h/!s and the opponent bids (double or overcall) at the 1 level, or
with less nuance if they bid at the 2 level.

1D--(P)--1H--(1S)
    2S = best invitational !h raise, maximum and shape
    3H = weak limit (4 card support, shape, probably a singleton)

1D--(1H)--X--(P)

    2H = best invitational 4 card !s support
    2S = weak limit (4 card support, shape, probably a singleton)

    2C = nothing special
    2H = best invitational 4 card !c support, maximum and shape
    3C = weak limit !c raise (4 card support, shape, probably a singleton)

Still on if 2nd position overcalls and advancer only bids 1N/2!c/2!d in 4th.

1D--(1H)--1S--(1N/2C/2D)
    X = 3 card support double, not rubbish if forced 3 level
    2C = 4 card support, often dead minimum
    2H = best invitational 4 card !c support, maximum and shape
    3C = weak limit !c raise (4 card support, shape, probably a singleton)

When they only overcall 2x then our cue bid is less nuanced at the 3 level. It is NOT a
stopper ask, as only natural invitational 3!d rebids (e.g. xx/Axx/AKQJxx/xxx) would benefit.

1D--(P)--1S--(2C)
    3C = good 3!s raise
    3S = weaker !s raise
    X = support, not rubbish VUL


**** Support doubles and redoubles by opener

- responder bids 1!h/1!s
- 4th hand bids, even NT bids
- 2nd hand's bid is irrelevant
- opener can X/XX or do a direct raise
- not required with xxx, especially with good defensive holdings
- responder's continuations are natural - NF 1N (maybe no stop) or 2 level bid, invitational 2N or 3 level, cue bid only GF

1D--(X)--1H--(1N)
    X = support double, 3 card support (!ss)
    raise = 4 card support (!s in this case as 1!h shows !ss)

1D--(P)--1H--(2C)--X--(P)
    2D = NF 3+ !ds, considering something better than a 4--3 !h fit
    2H = NF natural
    2S = natural 4--4 majors, forcing, invitational plus

Extended to the 3 level, (note penalty unlikely with an artificial 1!c system) but with more strength/shape:

1D--(1S)--X--(2S)
    X = support double, long strong !ds and exactly 3 card support for implied !h suit
    3H = 4 card support, above minimum presumably

Extended through to 4!h, again more strength needed so not doubling does not deny 3 card support:

1D--(X)--1H--(3H)
    X = support, 3 card support (for the !s transfer suit here), shapely maximum
        4N = [RKB](#RKB 4N) for Major
        4thSuit = unspecified slam try

Includes 4th hands bids where 2nd hand does not bid at all:

1D--(P)--1S--(4H)
    X = support


**** Extra trump redouble after settling in 2HS

1D--(P)--1S--(P)--2S--(P)--P--(X)
    XX = opener shows 4 card support as may have raised with only 3 cards

1D--(P)--1S--(P)--2S--(X)
    XX = responder now shows 5 cards, inviting opener to compete 3!s

**** Good-Bad 2N over 2DHS interference by 4th hand

- Good-Bad 2N is usually strong/good support or a bad/worse lower suit bid
- As a 1!d opener cannot have a long single suit, bad/worse will be both minors

1D--(any)--any--(2DHS)
    2N = Good-Bad with strong support or weaker minors hand
    3CD = minors, maximum

**** Choice of game 4x cue bids after Thrump double

- Iff our side shown values and not found a fit, constructive auction
- Actual cue bid or bid of suit they've artificially indicated
- always at least two places to play
- maybe slam try later, but assumed not

1D--(3!d)--X
    4D = choice of game, likely 3--3 majors

1D--(3!h)--X
    4H = choice of game, e.g. 4!h cue showing 3 card !s suit OR pick a minor ask
        4S = at least 5!ss
            4N = both minors, probably better !ds
            5C = both minors, better !cs

By responder example:

1D--(3!h)--X--(P)
    4C = opener's rebid
        4H = unsure of minor
            4S = 3 card support for !s

Single raise, 3+ cards

- could be light semi-preemptive

- use the "semi" forcing 1NT for the 3 card game invite
- opener needs a good hand to continue, usually 6 losers or better (note a 5 loser single suiter often opens 1!c)

- may include 3 card limit raise hands

Responding:

- The 2!c Gazilli variant response makes it impossible to play 2!c
- Gazilli also makes a 2!d sign off over 2!c impossible, though a 3!c/!d signoff is available
- 2C response bids with natural !c suits have extras in shape or hcp, otherwise normally stick with 1NT

** 1H--2C

Natural 2/1 GF (Reverse Drury by passed hand).

- Rebid of the major after 2/1 GF is "Bergen" style shape showing 6+ card suit (not catchall minimum)
- often 5 card !c suit (maybe 4 card with 3--2--4--4)
- never any 4--3--3--3 nor 4--4--3--2 with 3 or 4 card support (use 2N raise instead)
- Versus a passed hand, bids above 2!h are GF
- 2!h rebid versus a passed hand is never a maximum
- 3!h rebid versus a passed hand has lower requirements, just a max and 6 card suit

By a *passed hand* 2!c *Reverse Drury* shows a 9--10 limit raise with 3+ card support.

- Stronger than 1!d--2!h/!s (there is less preemptive value)
- Opener normally passes without fit.

2N = (semi)solid+ !hs, asking for 3N/4!hs with something in minors, otherwise back to 3!h, e.g. x/AKQJxxx/Ax/xxx
3CD = 6--5+ NF, long strong !hs and minor
3H = NF, "better" suit than your !ss
3S = invite
4CD = splinter, looking for miracle slam , e.g. Kxxx/AKxxxx/x/Ax
4HS = to play

** 1H--2N

invitational plus raise 3 (GF) or 4 card support.

- Normally invitational or slam try hands - game hands typically should end the auction quickly
- Natural systems with a standard "Jacoby 2N" only have 4+ card support, but with limited openings responder can take control so we allow 3 cards game forcing
- 4--4--3--2 / 4--3--3--3 hands should show 3 card support immediately
- With game values, 3 card support, 5 card side suit and slam interest can bid 2/1 GF first instead of 2N
- With 4 card support + 5 card side suit and no other side controls e.g. 5--4--2--2, can also bid 2/1 GF first then a
  jump raise to 4M shows e.g AJxx support, AKJxx side suit and nothing outside
- Consider if a 4 card raise is suitable for a splinter, there are two ranges ~10--13 3+ cover cards and 13--16 4.5+ cover cards
- With game values and almost no chance of slam consider bidding game directly
- Roughly like Jacoby, responder basically drives the auction, 3 level bids to show singleton, can stop in 3M

The response structure has just enough room for the 18 different hand types opener could show whilst
remaining below 4!h:

- (1) Minimum and balanced or semibalanced, unable to accept facing a four-card limit raise. With this hand type,
      opener will sign off in 3H unless responder shows extras.
- (2) Minimum unbalanced with a singleton !s, typically 1=5=(4=3) shape. With this hand type, we supply methods for
      opener to get to game if responder has no great wastage facing the singleton spade, but to sign off at 3H if the
      spade singleton fits responder’s hand poorly. We also allow for the possibility of stopping in 3NT if responder’s
      spade holding is suitable for that contract
- (3) Similar to (2), but with a singleton !d.
- (4) Similar to (2), but with a singleton !c.
- (5) Shape similar to (2), but with extra values. Opener is willing to drive to game regardless of what responder has;
      he wants to be in game even opposite a minimum limit raise with wasted spade cards. Opener defines his hand type
      on the way to game because responder may be interested in slam.
- (6) Shape similar to (2), but with extra values, singleton !d
- (7) Shape similar to (2), but with extra values, singleton !c
- (8) Maximum balanced or semibalanced and willingness to drive to game, usually 5--3--3--2/6--3--2--2. With this hand
      type, opener wants to allow for the possibility of playing 3NT, which can be very right if responder has 4333 shape,
      or 4432 with a strong doubleton
- (9) A semibalanced hand similar in playing strength to (8), but not willing to stop in 3NT. Opener will typically
      be 5422 or 7222 for this (fearing a lead in one of the doubleton suits).
- (10) Minimum strength opener, but with a void in !s; 0--5--4--4 or 0--6--(4-3) shape, but not much in high cards.
- (11) As (10), !d void
- (12) As (10), !c void
- (13) !s void, but this time with extra values, a hand that has suitable values for slam if partner is
       interested, max or slightly less and good controls
- (14) As (13), !d void
- (15) As (13), !c void
- (16) Two-suiter, 5--5+, good suits, extra values, with second suit !cs. If your hand is not strong enough for this bid,
       you can always show the location of a singleton or void by characterizing the hand as being one of the other types.
- (17) As (16), but !d second suit
- (18) Extra values with !ss as second suit, 5--6--1--1 or 4--7--1--1

** 1H--3CD

Limit jump shift, 6 card suit invitational, denying major support

- exact values depend on how easy it is for the suit to run in 3N
- possibly used with weak long suits like x/x/xxx/KQJ10xxxx, bid suit again over 3N
- bad long suits might bid 1N, then signoff, or just pass
- solid suit has more risk of not making 3N, but always drive to game with 7 cards solid and be more aggressive VUL IMPs

** 1H--3H

Mixed raise (weak limit raise) -- ~7--9(10) support points, 7.5--9 losers, 4+ cards, distributional unless 5+ cards

- New suit by opener is extreme two suiter slam try.
- Almost always wrong to bid game with 5--3--3--2/5--4--2--2.

** 1H--3S

Unknown singleton splinter, 10--13 hcp.

Splinter bids typically have fairly evenly distributed strength amongst the side suits as otherwise a 2/1 GF bid
of the strong suit is often better (unless the strong suit is mostly self-sufficient).

Splinter bidder promises 3--4 cover cards
outside of the shortness, e.g. Kxxx/Axxx/x/Axxx. After asking for the shortage opener counts
losers in other suits and with 6+ losers signs off, e.g. Jxx/KQxxx/KQJ/Qx easy to sign off
v.s. !d singleton. 5 losers is hardest to judge as opener needs to make a slam try and let
responder bid on with 4 cover cards or a void. Responder can always bid on once with 5+ cover cards,
though won't have that hand for a low tier 10--13 hcp splinter. When responder bids on opener is
ok with having 6 losers.

3N = ask
    4C = !c singleton
    4D = !d singleton
    4H = !s singleton

** 1H--3N/4C/4D

Short !s/!c/!d splinter, upper-tier ~13--16 hcp, 4.5+ cover cards. Possibly > 16 hcp if judge best route,
but will be driving to five level at least. Possibly void and needs to decide if should drive
to five level.

** 1S--2C

2/1 GF (Reverse Drury by passed hand).

- Rebid of the major after 2/1 GF is "Bergen" style shape showing 6+ card suit (not catchall minimum)
- Only likely 4 carder hands are 2--3--4--4 / 2--4--3--4 (and 1--4--4--4 playing a non-forcing NT)
- never 4--3--3--3 / 4--4--3--2 with 3 or 4 card support (use 2N raise instead)
- Versus a passed hand, bids above 2!s are GF
- 2!s rebid versus a passed hand is never a maximum
- 3!s rebid versus a passed hand has lower requirements, just a max and 6 card suit

By a *passed hand* 2!c *Reverse Drury* shows a 9--10 limit raise with 3+ card support.
Opener bids 2!s (fast arrival) with a (sub)minimum hand.

** 1S--2S

Single raise, 3+ cards

- could be light semi-preemptive
- not worth a mixed raise, so 4 card support hands probably flat or ~4--6 hcp
- use the "semi" forcing 1NT for the 3 card game invite
- opener needs a good hand to continue, usually 6 losers or better (note a 5 loser single suiter often opens 1!c)

2N = general game try, not exposing opener
    3CDH = natural trial bid, e.g. Qxxx KQxx xx xxx, cooperating - unsure of game

    4S = acceptance values or trump support e.g. AJxx xx J10x J10xx


** 1S--2N

invitational plus raise 3 (GF) or 4 card support.

- Normally invitational or slam try hands - game hands typically should end the auction quickly
- With game values, 3 card support, 5 card side suit and slam interest can bid 2/1 GF first instead of 2N
- With 4 card support + 5 card side suit and no other side controls e.g. 5--4--2--2, can also bid 2/1 GF first then a
  jump raise to 4M shows e.g AJxx support, AKJxx side suit and nothing outside
- Consider if a 4 card raise is suitable for a splinter, there are two ranges ~10--13 3--4 cover cards and 13--16 4.5+ cover cards
- Roughly like Jacoby, responder basically drives the auction, 3 level bids to show singleton, can stop in 3M

3C = artificial, multi-meaning.
(a) minimum (semi)balanced no singleton (5332, 6322, 5422, 7222)

(c) maximum, no shortness 5--4--2--2 or 6--3--2--2/7--2--2--2 with strength in main suit
(d) void hand, any strength

              4D = minimum, !h void, e.g. AKxxx/-/Axxx/Jxxx
              4H = minimum, !h singleton, but some shape so would accept game
              4S = dead minimum, !h singleton
          4CD = control bids, not interested in !h shortage
          4S = to play, no slam interest v.s. short !hs

*** Interference

[See 1H--2N Invite Plus Interference examples](#2N Invite Plus Interference)

** 1S--3CD

Limit jump shift, 6 card suit invitational, denying major support

- exact values depend on how easy it is for the suit to run in 3N
- possibly used with weak long suits like x/x/xxx/KQJ10xxxx, bid suit again over 3N
- bad long suits might bid 1N, then signoff, or just pass
- solid suit has more risk of not making 3N, but always drive to game with 7 cards solid and be more aggressive VUL IMPs

*** 1S--3C

3D = stopper, not natural necessarily, e.g. AJxxx/xxx/AQ/Axx wanting !h stop
3H = stopper, quasi-natural, responder can raise without 4th suit stopper and 3/4 card support

4C = Redwood for !cs
4D = splinter for !cs
4H = splinter for !cs

3S = natural, long suit, NF invitational, responder can raise with Hx
3N = to play, stopped
4C = Redwood for !ds

4H = splinter for !ds
4S = to play
4N = substitute !c splinter, with 2 aces as cannot use RKB

3S = natural, long suit, NF invitational, responder can raise with Hx
3N = to play, stopped
4C = Kickback [RKB](#RKB 4N) for !hs
4D = splinter for !hs
4HS = to play
4N = substitute !c splinter, with 2 aces as cannot use RKB

** 1S--3S

Mixed raise (weak limit raise) -- ~7--9(10) support points, 7.5--9 losers, 4+ cards, distributional unless 5+ cards

- New suit by opener is extreme two suiter slam try.
- Almost always wrong to bid game with 5--3--3--2/5--4--2--2.

** 1S--3N

Unknown singleton splinter, 10--13 hcp, 3--4 cover cards outside of shortage

Splinter bids typically have fairly evenly distributed strength amongst the side suits as otherwise a 2/1 GF bid
of the strong suit is often better (unless the strong suit is mostly self-sufficient).

4C = ask

    4H = !h shortage
    4S = !c shortage

** 1S--4C

XX = Ace showing by opener after opponents lead directing double

4D = ask
    4H = !h
    4S = !c
    4N+ = [RKB](#RKB 4N) response (1430...) with !c shortage

** 1S--4D

Maximum splinter, short !d, upper-tier ~13--16 hcp, 4.5+ cover cards.
(Fit jump by passed hand)

** 1S--4H/4S

To play, always. By a passed hand 4!h also implies some sort of !s fit, e.g Kxxxx/QJ10xxx/x/x

** 1S--4N

Normal Blackwood. Responder can bid their own suit at 5/6/7 level after opener shows aces.

    4HS = to play (passed hand - fit jump other major)

1S--(3x)
    X = negative
    3S = ~7--11 8--9 losers, 4 card support (maybe 3 plus strong trumps)
    NewSuit = forcing
    Cue = support showing, invitational or GF if below/above 3!ss
    4CD = [!s slam tries](#Major Opening and Responder's 4CD Slam Try)
    4S = minimal game values or moderate whilst lacking control

1S--(3DH) Thrump doubles for !d/!h overcalls
    Dbl = Thrump, negative like but looking for 3N, no major guarantee
        3S = 4 card major, no stopper
            4CD = maybe slam hunting, often shortish minor(s)
        3N = stopper
            4CD = slam hunting, often shortish minor(s)

1S--(3x) two suiter including suit bid
    lowCue = below 3!s, invitational in !ss
    highCue = above 3!s, GF in !ss
    X = penalty
    4CD = [!s slam tries](#Major Opening and Responder's 4CD Slam Try)

1S--(4C)
    4D = 15+ good 4!s raise

1S--(4D)
    X = negative
    4HS = natural
    4N = [RKB](#RKB 4N), not quantitative as forced to bid high

1S--(4H)
    X = penalty (generally negative X to 4!h but here !ss already bid)
    4S = natural
    4N = [RKB](#RKB 4N), not quantitative as forced to bid high

*** responder passing, 4th hand reopens

1S--(P)--P--(X)
    XX = artificial, good suit mild extras, 6 !ss, not shapely enough for 3!s bid
    1N = unspecified 4 card side suit on way to 2!s bid, e.g. KQJ10xx/xx/AJQx/x
        2x = lowest suit can play in
            2H = showing 4 card !h suit, 6 !ss
    2CD = 5 card suit normally

Responder can also re-open on their second bid, X takeout at the 2 level, but penalty
at the 3 level.
