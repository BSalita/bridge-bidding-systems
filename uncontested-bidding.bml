#+TITLE: General constructive auctions without interference

* 1D Opening

Short / Nebulous !d for flattish or 3 suited or both minors or extreme shape maximum 6+!d and 5!h/!s hands.

- Zero plus !d cards
- 11--(13) balanced/semi-balanced hands with 2+ card !d suit (poor vulnerable 11 hcp flat may pass)
- 11--(13) balanced hands in principle do not include any 5 card major hands
- 11--15 unbalanced 3 suiter (4--4--4--1 / 5--4--4--0) any short suit and without a 5 card major, so maybe minor canapé
- 11--15 both minors 5--4 / 5--5 (6--5 maximum could also use for more space), so maybe minor canapé.
- Rare extreme shape hands with extras include 6(7)!d--5!h/!s

Other bids:

- Open [2!c](#2C Intermediate Opening)/[2!d](#2D Intermediate Opening) with minimum 6--5 both minors and 2!c with 6--6 minor hands
- A maximum 6--5 minors can be supported by 1!d or the 2!c/2!d openings, experiment
- Open [2!d](#2D Intermediate Opening) with a 7!d--4!h/!s hand
- Improvise with 8!d--4!h/!s, probably best to open higher with 2!d expecting competition. It's a very rare 1:2211 frequency anyway.
- [Open 1!c](#1C Weak Strong) with any good 13--15 weak NT like hand, including many 5--4--2--2 five card !c/!d hands
- Open [1!h](#1H Opening) or [1!s](#1S Opening) with an 11--(13) hcp 5--3--3--2 major, unless willing to pretend it is a 4 card suit
- Open [1!h](#1H Opening) or [1!s](#1S Opening) with a minimum 6!d and 5 card !h/!s hand and bid like a 5--5 hand


1D = 11-(13) flat; or 11-15 3 suited no 5 card major or both minors (5–-4 / 5-–5); or maximum 6+!d--5!h/!s

            3D = GF, natural
            3H = GF, natural, in contrast to 3!h bid over 1!s, implies good 5 card !h, possible 5--2 fit if NT not safe
            3S = !s slam try, was checking strength

    4H = natural, too strong for direct 1!d--4!h bid, but not the stronger 1!d--1!h, then 3!h then 4!h slammish

*** 1D--1H--1N

- 11--13, which maybe offshape with shortage in partner's major or semi-balanced
- 14--15 (minors or 3 suited) hands will bid something else with a risk of skipping a reasonable 1N contract
- By judgement may treat a 4--4--4--1 14--15 hand as balanced, especially with a stiff honour

    2H = natural, invitational
    2S = 5--6 majors, invitational (most forcing hands bid 2!d)

    3H = invitational !s raise, maximum and shapely
    3S = weak limit, shapely, but weaker in HCP

When they only overcall 2x then our cue bid is less nuanced at the 3 level. It is NOT a
stopper ask, as only natural invitational 3!d rebids (e.g. xx/Axx/AKQJxx/xxx) would benefit.

1D--(P)--1S--(2C)
    3C = good 3!s raise
    3S = weaker !s raise


**** Support doubles and redoubles by opener

- responder bids 1!h/1!s
- 4th hand bids, even NT bids
- 2nd hand's bid is irrelevant
- opener can X/XX or do a direct raise
- not required with xxx, especially with good defensive holdings
- responder's continuations are natural - NF 1N (maybe no stop) or 2 level bid, invitational 2N or 3 level, cue bid only GF

1D--(X)--1H--(1N)
    X = support double, 3 card support (!ss)
    raise = 4 card support (!s in this case as 1!h shows !ss)

1D--(P)--1H--(2C)--X--(P)
    2D = NF 3+ !ds, considering something better than a 4--3 !h fit
    2H = NF natural
    2S = natural 4--4 majors, forcing, invitational plus

Extended to the 3 level, (note penalty unlikely with an artificial 1!c system) but with more strength:

1D--(1S)--X--(2S)
    X = support double, long strong !ds and exactly 3 card support for implied !h suit
    3H = 4 card support, above minimum presumably

Extended through to 4!h, again more strength needed so not doubling does not deny 3 card support:

1D--(X)--1H--(3H)
    X = support, 3 card support (for the !s transfer suit here), !d length shapely maximum
        4N = [RKB](#RKB 4N) for Major
        4thSuit = unspecified slam try

Includes 4th hands bids where 2nd hand does not bid at all:

1D--(P)--1S--(4H)
    X = support


**** Extra trump redouble after settling in 2HS

1D--(P)--1S--(P)--2S--(P)--P--(X)
    XX = opener shows 4 card support as may have raised with only 3 cards

1D--(P)--1S--(P)--2S--(X)
    XX = responder now shows 5 cards, inviting opener to compete 3!s

**** Four-Five hearts 2N response to opener's re-opening double

1D--(1S)--P--(2S)
    X = re-opening
        2N = "four-five hearts 2N" 4+ !hs, minimum
        3H = 4+ !hs, maximum OR some extra values with 5 !hs

1D--(2S)--P--(P)
    X = re-opening
        2N = "four-five hearts 2N" 4+ !hs, minimum
        3H = 4+ !hs, maximum OR some extra values with 5 !hs

**** Good-Bad 2N over 2DHS interference by 4th hand

1D--(any)--any--(2DHS)
    2N = "good-bad 2N" opener's relay to 3!c (e.g. both minors or weak !d)
    3C = longer !cs, better fit check
    3x = stronger hand

**** Choice of game cue bids v.s. high overcalls

- After 3 level or above overcalls
- Iff our side shown values and not found a fit, constructive auction
- Actual cue bid or bid of suit they've artificially indicated
- always at least two places to play
- maybe slam try later, but assumed not

1D--(3!h)--X
    4H = choice of game, e.g. 4!h cue showing 3 card !s suit OR pick a minor ask
        4S = at least 5!ss
            4N = both minors, probably better !ds
            5C = both minors, better !cs

By responder example:

1D--(3!h)--X--(P)
    4C = opener's rebid
        4H = unsure of minor
            4S = 3 card support for !s
            5C = 5 good !cs, medium !ds
            5D = six or 5 very good !ds

** 1H--1S

- 1-over-1 zero+ points, by judgement, helps obstruct etc. *Alertable*.
- maybe weak !d canapé, as well as any strength
- in-between hands uncertain of level likely to show 3 card !h support immediately
- 5+ !ss if also have !h support and limited values, but still need to control the auctions
- 4 !ss + 3+ card !h support is possible with GF values - it's easier to control the auction
- special note, hands with ~10--12 4!s and no 3 card !h support start with forcing NT then 2!s invitational NF (use direct 2!h with 10--12 and 3 card support)
- often pass with four !ss, doubleton !h and ~6--8(9) hcp

4S = to play, probably 5--6 in the majors, or 4 card support an shape (4--7)

** 1H--2H

Invite ~10--12 (9 with singleton), 3 card support (a Drury raise in all positions).

- use forcing NT for the "normal", weak 6--9 raise use
- a traditional forcing NT has to jump to 3M often risking one off
- frequently passed

4CD = natural, 5 cards, slam try, want partner to try [RKB](#RKB 4N) and go slam with 2 aces.
4H = any game hand, hiding information
4S = [Kickback RKB](#RKB 4N)
4N = Not happening.

** 1H--1N

Forcing NT, but less standard notes:

- 100% forcing, even by passed hand
- zero+ count if some fit exists
- standard single raise hand (6--9)
- Can pass with 6--(9) and only doubleton support, though may still bid to preempt in some way
- 4!ss and invitational values
- 1--4--4--4 GF hands will bid 1N instead of a 2/1 GF
- alertable:  "forcing, but does not promise any
values, and may be a hand that would have raised to 2H in standard methods; also
may be an invitational hand with a four-card spade suit."
- 2CD 3/4 card rebids can be done even with a maximum 6 card major waiting to see what partner bids (reraise on preference or try 3N with minor support)
as a jump major rebid should be an self-sufficient max 6 carder, ideally a good 7 carder

** 1H--2C

2/1 GF (10--12 by passed hand).

** 1H--2S

Weak jump shift, 0--9 six+ card suit

- Not strong enough for 1!s then 2!s invitational rebid.
- A second long minor is ignored unless it makes the hand distributionally strong enough to use an invitational 1!s then 2!s rebid.
- Opener normally passes without fit.

2N = solid !hs, asking for 3N/4!hs with something in minors, otherwise back to 3!h, e.g. x/AKQJxxx/Ax/xxx
3CD = 6--5+ NF, long strong !hs and minor
3H = NF, "better" suit than your !ss
3S = invite
4CD = splinter, looking for miracle slam , e.g. Kxxx/AKxxxx/x/Ax
4H = NF
4S = to play

** 1H--2N

invitational plus raise 3 (GF) or 4 card support.

- Normally invitational or slam try hands - game hands typically should end the auction quickly
- 4--4--3--2 / 4--3--3--3 hands should show 3 card support immediately
- With game values, 3 card support, 5 card side suit and slam interest can bid 2/1 GF first instead of 2N
- With 4 card support + 5 card side suit and no other side controls e.g. 5--4--2--2, can also bid 2/1 GF first then a
  jump raise to 4M shows e.g AJxx support, AKJxx side suit and nothing outside
- Consider if a 4 card raise is suitable for a splinter, there are two ranges ~10--13 3+ cover cards and 13--16 4.5+ cover cards
- Roughly like Jacoby, responder basically drives the auction, 3 level bids to show singleton, can stop in 3M

The response structure has just enough room for the 18 different hand types opener could show whilst
remaining below 4!h:

- (1) Minimum and balanced or semibalanced, unable to accept facing a four-card limit raise. With this hand type,
      opener will sign off in 3H unless responder shows extras.
- (2) Minimum unbalanced with a singleton !s, typically 1=5=(4=3) shape. With this hand type, we supply methods for
      opener to get to game if responder has no great wastage facing the singleton spade, but to sign off at 3H if the
      spade singleton fits responder’s hand poorly. We also allow for the possibility of stopping in 3NT if responder’s
      spade holding is suitable for that contract
- (3) Similar to (2), but with a singleton !d.
- (4) Similar to (2), but with a singleton !c.
- (5) Shape similar to (2), but with extra values. Opener is willing to drive to game regardless of what responder has;
      he wants to be in game even opposite a minimum limit raise with wasted spade cards. Opener defines his hand type
      on the way to game because responder may be interested in slam.
- (6) Shape similar to (2), but with extra values, singleton !d
- (7) Shape similar to (2), but with extra values, singleton !c
- (8) Maximum balanced or semibalanced and willingness to drive to game, usually 5--3--3--2/6--3--2--2. With this hand
      type, opener wants to allow for the possibility of playing 3NT, which can be very right if responder has 4333 shape,
      or 4432 with a strong doubleton
- (9) A semibalanced hand similar in playing strength to (8), but not willing to stop in 3NT. Opener will typically
      be 5422 or 7222 for this (fearing a lead in one of the doubleton suits).
- (10) Minimum strength opener, but with a void in !s; 0--5--4--4 or 0--6--(4-3) shape, but not much in high cards.
- (11) As (10), !d void
- (12) As (10), !c void
- (13) !s void, but this time with extra values, a hand that has suitable values for slam if partner is
       interested, max or slightly less and good controls
- (14) As (13), !d void
- (15) As (13), !c void
- (16) Two-suiter, 5--5+, good suits, extra values, with second suit !cs. If your hand is not strong enough for this bid,
       you can always show the location of a singleton or void by characterizing the hand as being one of the other types.
- (17) As (16), but !d second suit
- (18) Extra values with !ss as second suit, 5--6--1--1 or 4--7--1--1

** 1H--3CD

Limit jump shift, 6 card suit invitational, denying major support

- exact values depend on how easy it is for the suit to run in 3N
- possibly used with weak long suits like x/x/xxx/KQJ10xxxx, bid suit again over 3N
- bad long suits bid 1N forcing, then 2N invitational
- solid suit has more risk of not making 3N, but always drive to game with 7 cards solid and be more aggressive VUL IMPs

*** 1H--3C

3D = stopper, not natural necessarily, e.g. xxx/AJxxx/AQ/Axx wanting !s stop
3H = natural, long suit, NF invitational, responder can raise with Hx
3S = stopper, but 5--6/5--7 majors if pulls to 4!h over from 3N contract
3N = to play, stopped
4C = slam try forcing, looking for control bid
4D = Redwood for !cs

4D = slam try forcing, looking for control bid
4H = to play

4N = substitute short !c splinter, with 2 aces as cannot use RKB

** 1H--3H

Mixed raise (weak limit raise), ~7--9 support points and 4+ cards, distributional. Maybe no singleton.

- New suit by opener is extreme two suiter slam try.
- Almost always wrong to bid game with 5--3--3--2/5--4--2--2.

** 1H--3S

Unknown singleton splinter, 10--13 hcp.

Splinter bidder promises 3--4 cover cards
outside of the shortness, e.g. Kxxx/Axxx/x/Axxx. After asking for the shortage opener counts
losers in other suits and with 6+ losers signs off, e.g. Jxx/KQxxx/KQJ/Qx easy to sign off
v.s. !d singleton. 5 losers is hardest to judge as opener needs to make a slam try and let
responder bid on with 4 cover cards or a void. Responder can always bid on once with 5+ cover cards,
though won't have that hand for a low tier 10--13 hcp splinter. When responder bids on opener is
ok with having 6 losers.

3N = ask
    4C = !c singleton
    4D = !d singleton
    4H = !s singleton

** 1H--3N/4C/4D

Short !s/!c/!d splinter, upper-tier ~13--16 hcp, 4.5+ cover cards. Possibly > 16 hcp if judge best route,
but will be driving to five level at least. Possibly void and needs to decide if should drive
to five level.

    3CDS = fit jump
    3H = preemptive (use transfer for mixed raise)

** 1S--2S

Invite ~10--12 (9 with singleton), 3 card support (a Drury raise in all positions).

- use forcing NT for the "normal", weak 6--9 raise use
- a traditional forcing NT has to jump to 3M often risking one off
- frequently passed

2N = relay to long suit game try
    3C = puppet
        3D = long !d
        3H = long !h

** 1S--2N

invitational plus raise 3 (GF) or 4 card support.

- Normally invitational or slam try hands - game hands typically should end the auction quickly
- With game values, 3 card support, 5 card side suit and slam interest can bid 2/1 GF first instead of 2N
- With 4 card support + 5 card side suit and no other side controls e.g. 5--4--2--2, can also bid 2/1 GF first then a
  jump raise to 4M shows e.g AJxx support, AKJxx side suit and nothing outside
- Consider if a 4 card raise is suitable for a splinter, there are two ranges ~10--13 3--4 cover cards and 13--16 4.5+ cover cards
- Roughly like Jacoby, responder basically drives the auction, 3 level bids to show singleton, can stop in 3M

3C = artificial, multi-meaning.
(a) minimum (semi)balanced no singleton (5332, 6322, 5422, 7222)
(b) minimum with singleton !h, note can drive to game later if e.g. mid-range 10 cards in two suits
(c) maximum, no shortness 5--4--2--2 or 6--3--2--2/7--2--2--2 with strength in main suit
(d) void hand, any strength
  3D = relay, better than 3!s bid (fine in game v.s. minimum with !h singleton)
      3H = short !h, singleton and relative minimum or void any strength
          3S = NF, no game interest v.s. minimum with singleton !h

              4H = minimum, !h singleton, but some shape so would accept game
              4S = dead minimum, !h singleton
          4CD = control bids, not interested in !h shortage
          4S = to play, no slam interest v.s. short !hs

    4S = to play, no slam interest
    4N = [RKB](#RKB 4N)
3N = any maximum 5--3--3--2/6--3--2--2, all suits stopped
    4N = [RKB](#RKB 4N)
4CDH = maximum, 5--5+, responder should only care about the Ace in other suits
4S = only used v.s. passed hand, fast arrival
4N = [RKB](#RKB 4N)
5CDH = [EKB Voidwood](#EKB Voidwood)

*** Interference

[See 1H--2N Invite Plus Interference examples](#2N Invite Plus Interference)

** 1S--3CD

Limit jump shift, 6 card suit invitational, denying major support

- exact values depend on how easy it is for the suit to run in 3N
- possibly used with weak long suits like x/x/xxx/KQJ10xxxx, bid suit again over 3N
- bad long suits bid 1N forcing, then 2N invitational
- solid suit has more risk of not making 3N, but always drive to game with 7 cards solid and be more aggressive VUL IMPs

*** 1S--3C

3D = stopper, not natural necessarily, e.g. AJxxx/xxx/AQ/Axx wanting !h stop
3H = stopper, quasi-natural, responder can raise without 4th suit stopper and 3/4 card support
3S = natural, long suit, NF invitational, responder can raise with Hx
3N = to play, stopped
4C = slam try forcing, looking for control bid
4D = Redwood for !cs
4H = splinter for !cs
4S = to play
4N = substitute short !d splinter, with 2 aces as cannot use RKB

*** 1S--3D

Similar to 1!h--3!c:

3H = stopper, quasi-natural, responder can raise without 4th suit stopper and 3/4 card support
3S = natural, long suit, NF invitational, responder can raise with Hx
3N = to play, stopped
4C = Redwood for !ds
4D = slam try forcing, looking for control bid
4H = splinter for !ds
4S = to play
4N = substitute short !c splinter, with 2 aces as cannot use RKB

*** 1S--3H

Not as much suit quality required as the minor bids as directed to a major game instead of NT

3S = natural, long suit, NF invitational, responder can raise with Hx
3N = to play, stopped
4C = control bid, !hs agreed
4D = Kickback [RKB](#RKB 4N) for !hs
4HS = to play

** 1S--3S

Mixed raise (weak limit raise), ~7--9 support points and 4+ cards, distributional. Maybe no singleton.

- New suit by opener is extreme two suiter slam try.
- Almost always wrong to bid game with 5--3--3--2/5--4--2--2.

** 1S--4D

Maximum splinter, short !d, upper-tier ~13--16 hcp, 4.5+ cover cards.
(Fit jump by passed hand)

** 1S--4H/4S

To play, always. By a passed hand 4!h also implies some sort of !s fit, e.g Kxxxx/QJ10xxx/x/x

** 1S--4N

Normal Blackwood. Responder can bid their own suit at 5/6/7 level after opener shows aces.


** 1S interference
