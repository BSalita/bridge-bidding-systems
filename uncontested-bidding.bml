#+TITLE: General constructive auctions without interference

* 1D Opening

- 11--(13) balanced/semi-balanced hands with 2+ card !d suit
- 11--15 unbalanced, maybe longer 5+ card !c suit (canapé)
- 11--15 (4!h/!s--1)--3--5 is the only unbalanced non-natural !d opening
- 12--15 4--4--4--1 with 4 !ds
- [Open 1!c](#1C Weak Strong) with any good 13--15 weak NT like hand, including many 5--4--2--2 five card !c/!d hands.
- [Open 2!d](#2D Precision Style 3 Suiter) with a short !d 3 suiter

** 1H--2C

2/1 GF (10--12 by passed hand). Note, very little evidence that 2/1 GF vs NF (weak) matters when playing a forcing NT.
The old-fashioned ~9/10+ NF invitational style is equally unlikely to make much difference.
The difficulty with standard 2/1 GF is how opener shows extras, but that's easier with club systems
due to limited openings. In addition to the club system there will always be a bid to show a minimum.

- Rebid of the major after 2/1 GF shows the minimum or other catchall bids, not a 6th card
- usually 5 card !c suit (only likely 4 carder is 3--2--4--4)
- never 4--3--3--3 / 4--4--3--2 with card support (use 2N raise instead)
- Versus a passed hand, bids above 2!h are GF
- 2!h rebid versus a passed hand is never a maximum
- 3!h rebid versus a passed hand has lower requirements, just a max and 6 card suit

2D = second 4+ suit, any strength, may have 4 !ss (4--5--4--0) or 6th !h

    3H = 3 card support, slam interest, serious/Fred 3N (bid 4!h without slam interest)
    4N = quantitative, directly or later on...
3C = natural 3+ cards, extras in shape or hcp, (best hands will splinter or bid 4!c though)
    any = 3N contracted directed, unless going past 3N voluntarily
3D = splinter for !cs, good hcp (long !ds start with 2!d)
3H = natural, maximum, versus unpassed hand a good suit max 1 loser e.g. KQJ10xx+

4S = void splinter for !ds

** 1H--2S

Weak jump shift, 0--9 six+ card suit

- Not strong enough for 1!s then 2!s invitational rebid.
- A second long minor is ignored unless it makes the hand distributionally strong enough to use an invitational 1!s then 2!s rebid.
- Opener normally passes without fit.

2N = solid !hs, asking for 3N/4!hs with something in minors, otherwise back to 3!h, e.g. x/AKQJxxx/Ax/xxx
3CD = 6--5+ NF, long strong !hs and minor
3H = NF, "better" suit than your !ss
3S = invite
4CD = splinter, looking for miracle slam , e.g. Kxxx/AKxxxx/x/Ax
4H = NF
4S = to play

** 1H--2N

Invitational+ raise 4 card support.

- Normally invitational or slam try hands - game hands typically should end the auction quickly
- 4--4--3--2 / 4--3--3--3 hands should show 3 card support immediately
- With game values, 3 card support, 5 card side suit and slam interest can bid 2/1 GF first instead of 2N
- Roughly like Jacoby, responder basically drives the auction, 3 level bids to show singleton, can stop in 3M

The response structure has just enough room for the 18 different hand types opener could show whilst
remaining below 4!h:

- (1) Minimum and balanced or semibalanced, unable to accept facing a four-card limit raise. With this hand type,
      opener will sign off in 3H unless responder shows extras.
- (2) Minimum unbalanced with a singleton !s, typically 1=5=(4=3) shape. With this hand type, we supply methods for
      opener to get to game if responder has no great wastage facing the singleton spade, but to sign off at 3H if the
      spade singleton fits responder’s hand poorly. We also allow for the possibility of stopping in 3NT if responder’s
      spade holding is suitable for that contract
- (3) Similar to (2), but with a singleton !d.
- (4) Similar to (2), but with a singleton !c.
- (5) Shape similar to (2), but with extra values. Opener is willing to drive to game regardless of what responder has;
      he wants to be in game even opposite a minimum limit raise with wasted spade cards. Opener defines his hand type
      on the way to game because responder may be interested in slam.
- (6) Shape similar to (2), but with extra values, singleton !d
- (7) Shape similar to (2), but with extra values, singleton !c
- (8) Maximum balanced or semibalanced and willingness to drive to game, usually 5--3--3--2/6--3--3--2. With this hand
      type, opener wants to allow for the possibility of playing 3NT, which can be very right if responder has 4333 shape,
      or 4432 with a strong doubleton
- (9) A semibalanced hand similar in playing strength to (8), but not willing to stop in 3NT. Opener will typically
      be 5422 or 7222 for this (fearing a lead in one of the doubleton suits).
- (10) Minimum strength opener, but with a void in !s; 0--5--4--4 or 0--6--(4-3) shape, but not much in high cards.
- (11) As (10), !d void
- (12) As (10), !c void
- (13) !s void, but this time with extra values, a hand that has suitable values for slam if partner is
       interested, max or slightly less and good controls
- (14) As (13), !d void
- (15) As (13), !c void
- (16) Two-suiter, 5--5+, good suits, extra values, with second suit !cs. If your hand is not strong enough for this bid,
       you can always show the location of a singleton or void by characterizing the hand as being one of the other types.
- (17) As (16), but !d second suit
- (18) Extra values with !ss as second suit, 5--6--1--1 or 4--7--1--1

3C = artificial, multi-meaning.
(a) minimum (semi)balanced no singleton (5332, 6322, 5422, 7222)

(c) maximum, no shortness 5--4--2--2 or 6--3--3--2/7--2--2--2 with strength in main suit
(d) void hand, any strength

          3N = to play

              4D = void !s, minimum, e.g. -/AKxxx/Axxx/Jxxx
              4H = singleton !s minimum, e.g. x/AKxxx/Axxx/Jxx
          4CD = control bids, not interested in !s shortage
          4H = to play, no slam interest v.s. short !ss

    3N = to play, with !c stoppers
3S = maximum, unknown singleton. The !c singleton may not be slam suitable, game only.
    3N = ask, slam interest normally

4H = maximum, 5!s--6!h / 7!h--4!s--1--1 OR versus passed hand fast arrival game bid
4S = Kickback [RKB](#RKB 4N)
4N = [EKB Voidwood](#EKB Voidwood) !s void
5CD = [EKB Voidwood](#EKB Voidwood)

** 1H--3CD

Limit jump shift, 6 card suit invitational, denying major support

- exact values depend on how easy it is for the suit to run in 3N
- possibly used with weak long suits like x/x/xxx/KQJ10xxxx, bid suit again over 3N
- bad long suits bid 1N forcing, then 2N invitational
- solid suit has more risk of not making 3N, but always drive to game with 7 cards solid and be more aggressive VUL IMPs

*** 1H--3C

3D = stopper, not natural necessarily, e.g. xxx/AJxxx/AQ/Axx wanting !s stop
3H = natural, long suit, NF invitational, responder can raise with Hx
3S = stopper, but 5--6/5--7 majors if pulls to 4!h over from 3N contract
3N = to play, stopped
4C = slam try forcing, looking for control bid
4D = Redwood for !cs
4H = to play
4S = splinter for !cs
4N = substitute short !d splinter, with 2 aces as cannot use RKB

*** 1H--3D

Similar to 1!h--3!c:

3H = natural, long suit, NF invitational, responder can raise with Hx
3S = stopper, but 5--6/5--7 majors if pulls to 4!h over from 3N contract
3N = to play, stopped
4C = Redwood for !ds
4D = slam try forcing, looking for control bid
4H = to play
4S = splinter for !ds
4N = substitute short !c splinter, with 2 aces as cannot use RKB

** 1H--3H

Mixed raise (weak limit raise), ~7--9 4 (5) card support, distributional. Maybe no singleton.

- New suit by opener is extreme two suiter slam try.
- Almost always wrong to bid game with 5--3--3--2/5--4--2--2.

** 1H--3S

Unknown singleton splinter, 10--13 hcp.

Splinter bidder promises at least 3 cover cards
outside of the shortness, e.g. Kxxx/Axxx/x/Axxx. After asking for the shortage opener counts
losers in other suits and with 6+ losers signs off, e.g. Jxx/KQxxx/KQJ/Qx easy to sign off
v.s. !d singleton. 5 losers is hardest to judge as opener needs to make a slam try and let
responder bid on with 4 cover cards or a void. Responder can always bid on once with 5+ cover cards,
though won't have that hand for a low tier 10--13 hcp splinter. When responder bids on opener is
ok with having 6 losers.

3N = ask
    4C = !s singleton
    4D = !d singleton
    4H = !c singleton

** 1H--3N/4C/4D

Short !s/!c/!d splinter, upper-tier ~13--16 hcp, 4.5+ cover cards. Possibly > 16 hcp if judge best route,
but will be driving to five level at least. Possibly void and needs to decide if should drive
to five level.

XX = Ace showing by opener after opponents lead directing double

4S = Kickback [RKB](#RKB 4N), maybe important to bid if 4!c/4!d was doubled and 5!c/!d raise impending

1H--1N--(2DS)
    X = takeout, e.g. x/AKxxx/Axxx/Qxx of 2!s overcall

Two level overcalls passed backaround to responder, e.g. 1H--1N--(2D)--P--(P), bids are as if uninterrupted,
e.g. 2!s showing 4!ss exactly and NF invite.

After bids/raises by opponents to the three level, bids show much the same as the uninterrupted 2 level

a little.

1H--1N--(3x)
    X = takeout, good hand extra strength

** 1S--2N

Invitational+ raise 4 card support.

- Normally invitational or slam try hands - game hands typically should end the auction quickly
- With game values, 3 card support, 5 card side suit and slam interest can bid 2/1 GF first instead of 2N
- Roughly like Jacoby, responder basically drives the auction, 3 level bids to show singleton, can stop in 3M

3C = artificial, multi-meaning.
(a) minimum (semi)balanced no singleton (5332, 6322, 5422, 7222)

(c) maximum, no shortness 5--4--2--2 or 6--3--3--2/7--2--2--2 with strength in main suit
(d) void hand, any strength

4N = [RKB](#RKB 4N)
5CDH = [EKB Voidwood](#EKB Voidwood)

** 1S--3CD

Limit jump shift, 6 card suit invitational, denying major support

- exact values depend on how easy it is for the suit to run in 3N
- possibly used with weak long suits like x/x/xxx/KQJ10xxxx, bid suit again over 3N
- bad long suits bid 1N forcing, then 2N invitational
- solid suit has more risk of not making 3N, but always drive to game with 7 cards solid and be more aggressive VUL IMPs

*** 1S--3C

3D = stopper, not natural necessarily, e.g. AJxxx/xxx/AQ/Axx wanting !h stop

4HS = to play

** 1S--3S

Mixed raise (weak limit raise), ~7--9 4 (5) card support, distributional. Maybe no singleton.

** 1S--4H/4S

To play, always. By a passed hand 4!h also implies some sort of !s fit, e.g Kxxxx/QJ10xxx/x/x

** 1S--4N

Normal Blackwood. Responder can bid their own suit at 5/6/7 level after opener shows aces.


** 1S interference

Similar to [1H interference](#1H interference).

    3H = GF, 6+ suit when unpassed, fit jump passed hand
    3S = mixed raise (weak limit)

1H--(2!d)
    X = negative or GF bidding a weaker suit next time or stop asking
    2H = negative freebid, 0--10
    2S = natural
    2N = natural invitational
    3C = forcing, 6+ suit when unpassed, invite passed hand
    3D = invite+ !ss
    3H = GF, 6+ suit when unpassed, Fit Jump passed hand
    3S = mixed raise (weak limit)

1S--(2!h)

    2S = normal natural raise
    2N = natural invitational
    3CD = natural, forcing
    3H = invite+ !ss
    3S = mixed raise (weak limit)

*** responder passing, 4th hand reopens

1S--(P)--P--(X)
    XX = artificial, good suit mild extras, 6 !ss, not shapely enough for 3!s bid
    1N = unspecified 4 card side suit on way to 2!s bid, e.g. KQJ10xx/xx/AJQx/x
        2x = lowest suit can play in
            2H = showing 4 card !h suit, 6 !ss
    2CD = 5 card suit normally

Responder can also re-open on their second bid, X takeout at the 2 level, but penalty
at the 3 level.

* Constructive uncontested auctions

Meanings of things like jump rebids, jump shifts and tools to show
support for partner.

** Jump Rebids, Opener

1DHS--any
    3DHS = strong suit, max range, at least semi-solid (4 tricks probable opposite xx).

1DHS--1HS
    2N = 3 card support, min
    3N = 3 card support, max

1DHS--2H
    3N = 3 card support, max

** Jump Rebids, Responder

12+ hcp, strong suit, at least semi-solid (4 tricks probable opposite xx).

** Two Suited Rebids, Opener

Most bids are obvious, do what you can with your strength.
It depends if partner did a 2--over--1 bid.

- 1-over-1 then jump shifts below 4 level require 5--5+
- 4 level jump shifts are splinters for partner's response suit

** Two Suited Rebids, Responder

Much as with opener:

- Jump shift below 4 level shows 5--5+ shape
- 4 level jump shifts are splinters
- Rebid of a suit at the 3 level following opener's reverse is GF

** Forcing / Non-Forcing

- 1DHS and following auctions with 2 suits are NF.
- Responder bidding a third suit, is F1. Opener rebidding their suit for the third time is NF (1!d--1!s--2!d--2!h--3!d),
  all else GF.
- Pulling 2N is GF unless known to be limited
- After opener's reverse (1!d--1!s--2!h), responder picking one of their suits or 2N is NF. All else GF.
