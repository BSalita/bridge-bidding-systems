#+TITLE: Natural intermediate 2C Opening

* 2C Opener

2!c = 11--15 hcp, 6+ card suit. Maybe leading directing 5 card !c suit in 3rd.

- Open 1!c with 5--4--2--2, 5!c + 4 card major and (11)12-15.
- Open 1!d with 5--4--2--2 and both minors, possibly 1!c with honours in the doubletons.
- Open 1NT with 5--4--2--2, 5!c + 4 card major and 16 hcp, possibly with 17--18 aswell.
- Open 2!d with 5!c longest and short !d (4--4--0--5!c, 4--3--1--5!c, or 3--4--1--5!c)

Responding:

- 2!h/2!s are NF natural bids. Beware opener may rebid their suit with a singleton and take the auction to the 3 level, pass can be safer though looking for a major can score better at match points.
- Except for 2N (!d transfer without major) and 3N/4!h/4!s (natural), most *invitational+ hands* use the *2!d enquiry*, whether shapely or balanced.
- Hands with one or both majors and invitational+ values can use 2!d but be willing to go to game despite potential misfits if opener is maximum.
- The 2!d enquiry is also used with weaker !d hands looking for major fit before signing off.
- 3!c slam try, 4!c preempt, again invitational !cs go via the 2!d enquiry.
- 3!d (5--5+ majors invite+) and 3!h/3!s (5 card major and 6+ !ds GF) are all artificial special bids.


2C--
    (any) = [interference defence](#2C Interference)
    2D = [enquiry, many invite+ or weak !d hands](#2D enquiry)
    2HS = natural, NF, 5+ (usually 6) suit, ~7--11 hcp, unlikely both majors (both majors invite+ use 2!d)
        P = doubleton major support typically
        2S = natural, NF, 4+ suit, no !h support,
        2N = singleton major support, maximum and stoppers in other suits, NF
            3x = NF, new suit or escape to !c or major
        3C = singleton major support
        3D/oM = NF, natural, 5 card suit. 3!s over 2!h is nearly GF.
            4thSuit = equal preference for game suit
        3HS = 3 card support, NF, not complete minimum

        4M = 4 card support, shot at games
    2N = !d transfer and no 4 card major, any strength with ok, long !d suit.
        3C = no !d fit
            3D = signing off (weak or was invite, but no !d fit)
            3M = stopper, game looking, can end in 3N or 4!c/4!d
                3S = partial !s stopper, unsure of 3N, can end in 3N or 4!c/4!d
