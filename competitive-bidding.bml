#+TITLE: Contested Auctions

* Competitive Auctions

** Overcalls

- Generally based more on shape than exact strength
- 1 level light major suit overcalls, e.g. 8+ hcp 6--3--3--1

*** 4th balancing of 1x openings

- same strengths
- same 2 suiter bids
- slightly more chance of 4 card suit, e.g. AQJ10/Axxx/xxxx/x
- jumps are good hands, but again special 2 suiter bids are the same shapes
- 1N is 12--15 over 1!c/!d, 13--16 over 1!h/!s
- 2N is natural stronger than X then NT bid, not unusual
- jump cue bid is a stopper ask
- 4x jumps are natural

*** Passed hand balancing

- Over (1!h) 1N is long minor + 4 !ss
- Over (1!s) 1N is !h + minor 5--5
- 2N would be 6--5 lower unbid suits

** Doubles

- Is it a standard *negative* double situation? Negative X played to 4!h. Promising the unbid major(s) or ability
  to handle the auction based on partner's next bid. Used to start a *stop ask* (Directional Asking Bid) or make a
  flattish 3 card 8--10 hcp raise.
- Is it a standard *competitive* double situation? Competitive X played to 3!s. Double of opponents' raised suit
  when partner has opened or overcalled when no other 3x game try bid available: 1H--(2D)--2H--(3D)--X but not 1H--(2C)--2H--(3C)--X where 3!d can be the game try bid.
- Is it a standard *responsive* double situation? Responsive X played to 3!s. Partner does takeout X of Opener and
  then we X the opponents' raise (whether artificial - e.g. HCR or natural).

If these do not apply then some blanket rules exist.

Blanket rules apply up to 2!s - if not sure above 2!s assume penalty (others play this to 3!s).
*"All doubles of bids through 2!s are takeout UNLESS"*:

1. It's defined above as one of *Negative, Competitive or Responsive*
2. our side bid 1N
3. our side bid and raised a suit
4. our side redoubled
5. our side made a penalty double or penalty pass
6. the bid doubled was artificial
7. partner pre-empts


*** Delayed Takeout Doubles

When not doubling on the first round:

- X is typically long in the opponents' first bid suit
    - short in a opener's second bid suit
    - short in responders bid suit when opener rebids the same suit
- decent strength, often 4 card suits competing

When would force to the 3 level:

    - X is penalty, e.g. showing minors and forcing to 3 level
    - 2N is minors takeout
    - e.g. (1H)--(1S)--(2H)--X

When minor rebid after 1N reponse:

(1D)--(1N)--(2D)
    X = light takeout, not implying length in their suit nor a stronger hand

When major rebid after 1N reponse, this may forces to the 3 level so:

(1H)--(1N)--(2H)
    X = penalty, not light takeout as too risky

*** (1suit)--(1N) Balancing Double and Cue Bid

When they pass out 1N:

(1CD)--(1N)--(P)  minors suit
    X = takout short in OTHER minor, similar to delayed takeout, long in bid suit, e.g. Axxx/AQxx/Kxxx/x after (1!d) opening

(1HS)--(1N)--(P)  majors suit
    X = pointless? takeout but long in opening suit, reasonable strength, risky

(1CDHS)--(1N)--(P)
    Cue = natural, weak jump overcall strength (obviously risky vs 5 card major openings)

*** Stolen Double by advancer - Opponents' HCR double

(1H)--1S--(2S/3S)
    X = "Stolen" bid, double I would have bid that.

*** Extra Length 2 Level Double of Cuebid - Partner not bid

1H--(1S)--P--(2H)
    X = extra !h length, extra values inviting 3!h bid with Hx+ support
    3H = very good suit and shape, extras

Other examples:

- 1D--(1HS)--P--(2D)--X
- 1S--(2CDH)--P--(2S)--X

Pass then later X would allow opener to compete in the minors suits.

*** Lead Undirecting 3 Level Double of Cuebid - Partner not bid

Assuming we have no chance of winning the auction here

1H--(2S)--P--(3H)
    X = do NOT lead !hs
    P = happy with !h lead
    4CDH = extreme shape, extras

*** Double Showing HCR by advancer - Opponents' raise

- (1x) then 1!h/!s overcall by us then the opponents raise to (2x/3x)
- Or sandwich position opponents bid two different suits, e.g (1D)--P--(1S)--2H--(2DS)

X then shows a HCR.

*** Tolerance Double by advancer - Opponents bid two suits

(1x) then 1!h/!s overcall by us then a simple new suit responder, e.g. (1D)--1!h--(1S/2C)--X.

- tolerance, doubleton support
- dislikes 1N bid
- 9+ hcp, wants to hear a rebid from overcaller with a 6 card suit

*** Fit Jump by Opponents' Double - when we overcalled

(1H)--1S--(3C)
    X = !s fit and 4th suit (artificial fit showing)

When 3!c showing !cs and !h fit

*** Redouble of Negative Double - when we simple overcalled

E.g. (1!c)--1!s--X--XX, (1!d)--1!h--X--XX, (1!s)--2!d--X--XX

- doubleton, typically Hx (may have hand that prefers to bid e.g. 1N)
- 9+ shows decent values (especially remember 1M overcalls can be light)

*** Extra trump redouble - we stop 2HS they takeout X

Examples:

1D--(P)--1S--(P)--2S--(P)--P--(X)
    XX = opener shows 4 card support as may have raised with only 3 cards

1D--(P)--1S--(P)--2S--(X)
    XX = responder now shows 5 cards, inviting opener to compete 3!s

1M--(P)--1N--(P)--2M--(X)
    XX = responder has 3+ card support opposite 6 cards

1M--(P)--1N--(P)--2CD--(P)--2M--(X)
    XX = opener has 6 cards

1M--(P)--2M--(X)
    XX = pointless?, 6 cards, dead minimum presumably as facing a 3 card invite

1N--(P)--2D--(P)--2H--(P)--P--(X)
    XX = opener has 3 card support

1C--(P)--1S--(P)--2S--(P)--P--(X)
    XX = 5 card weak NT hand

1C--(P)--1S--(P)--2S--(X)
    XX = responder now shows 5 cards, inviting opener to compete 3!s

1C--(P)--1H--(P)--1S--(P)--2S--(X)
    XX = opener has 5 cards

*** FSF Redouble or Other Artificial Forcing Bids

When opponents double an artificial bid for lead direction

- XX for strong play suggestion
- Pass to play if partner can help in support e.g. Hxx+
- Cannot play in the contract only doubled, must be redoubled
- Otherwise bid on as if not doubled


*** 3N Contract Lead Directing Double

Standard meanings by the defender sitting under the declarer:

- lead my suit
- lead our suit (we both bid obvious)
- lead dummies first bid suit
- lead shortest major if not suits mentioned


...TODO, Fit Jumps, HCR etc.


** OBAR 4th seat bids

"Opponents Bid And Raise â€“ Balance In Direct Seat"

Opponents bid raise a fit below 2!s (1CDH)--(2CDH), then a 4th position bid is based
on law total tricks theory and caution depending on vulnerability, length in their suit etc.

E.g. (1H)--(2H) then bid 2!s on KQJxx/xx/J10x/xxx vulnerability dependent.


** Bidding to 4CD over 3HS competition is Invitational

E.g. (1S)--2D--(2S)--(3D)--(3S)

- 4D in this example is a game try
- Expecting to make 4 v.s. average hand, and game v.s. good hand

Designed for IMPs, only in matchpoints might it be worth to compete to 4!d - in IMPS 3M is never a great final contract
as it risks going one off or worse making a game.

** Unforced Rebids Show Extra Length, Not Values

E.g. playing transfer advances, (1C)--1!s--(P)--2!h--(X)

- 2!h is a transfer advance with !s support
- opener can pass with nothing to say
- complete the transfer with an extra trump, still minimum
- XX shows extra values, NOT LIGHT overcall, but not want to go higher if partner is minimum 10--12


** Rubens Transfer Advances

Overcall response method aiding showing a wider range of strengths.
Lets us show a good suit but a bad hand without support (escaping/signoff)
or a hand that can bid on (supporting partner would show fewer cards e.g. doubleton, no a valid fit jump).

May use something different e.g. multi-meaning 2!c advancer's response bid from the competitive bids book.

When there is room between opener's suit and partner's overcalled suit e.g. (1!c)--1!s / (1!c)--1!h
but not (1!d)--1!h / (1!h)--1!s (no suits skipped by the overcall), then suit bids (not NT) are transfers,
iff opener's partner passes or just doubles or single raises:

(1C)--1!s--(P/X)
  2C = !d transfer, possibly with !s support to be shown later
  2D = !h transfer, possibly with !s support to be shown later
  2H = !s HCR
  2S = normal 2x raise

(1C)--1!s--(2!c)
    X = !d transfer
    2D = !h transfer
    2H = !s HCR
    2S = normal 2x raise

but when suits are touching:

(1H)--1!s--(P/X)
    2C = natural, forcing
    2D = natural, forcing
    2H = !s HCR
    2S = normal 2x raise

(1S)--2!h--(P/X)
    2S = !c transfer
    2N = natural
    3C = !d transfer
    3D = !h HCR

(1S)--2!h--(P/X)

Works with jump overcalls aswell:

(2C)--3S--(P/X)
    4C = !d tranfer
    4D = !h transfer
    4H = !s hcr
    4S = weaker !s support


** Opener's Second Round Double - After Partner's 2 Level WJS or NFB

Double shows support and extras in shape or HCP

1D--(P)--2H--(2S)
    X = extras, support
    3H = competitive

1D--(1S)--2C--(2S)
    X = extras, support
    3C = competitive

** Opener's Renegative Double for Both Majors

1D--(2C)--X--(3C)
    X = 3 cards both majors, extras

1C--(1D)--X--(2D)
    X = 4 cards both majors, good weak NT OR prelude to forcing with strong !c hand

** Opener's Good-Bad 2N Rebid in Competition

After (2DHS) in 4th by the opposition (RHS of opener), 2N shows a weaker hand.

1H--(P)--1N--(2S)
    2N = good-bad, assumed weak !c suit in this case
    3C = maximum, natural

1H--(P)--1S--(2C)
    2DH = natural
    2N = natural, presumably solid-ish !ds and !c stop

1H--(P)--1S--(2D)
    2N = good-bad

* Opponents Open 1NT

Competing over 1NT. More aggressive when opponents are NonVulnerable.

- Whether with/without interference from opener/responder, new suits shows some SUPP. E.G. (1N)--2H--2S = double fit to some extent.
- Raise mostly competitive, bid game w/ good max.
- X is *penalty* against *non-strong NT*
- X is *takeout* against *Strong NT*, some shape with *4--5 spades*, 12+ HCP
- *4th* sitting under X is *always takeout* with *4--5 spades*, 12+ HCP
- Note, X as T/O could also be played at Matchpoints, but need a strength bid for IMPs vs weak notrumps so donâ€™t miss game

** When opponents run from 1N doubled

- Lebensohl is on -- 2 bids are to play
- X of a natural suit by doubler's partner is 2--3 trumps. Can pass with 4 trumps, or wait for re-opening double.
- Doubler's partner maybe passing with penalty interest (after a future re-opening X) or weak hand that wants to escape
  with both majors -- expecting a re-opening double.
- Another double from the penalty doubler is re-opening.
- Note, maybe better to play X of a Major by doubler's partner as takeout, but another memory strain.
