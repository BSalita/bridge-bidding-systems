** We Overcall or X/XX Summary

- Generally based more on shape than exact strength
- 1 level light major suit overcalls, ~8+ hcp and sensible suits with low hcp
- Minor overcalls more likely 10+ reasonable opening bids
- 2 level minor overcalls are fine on "bad" 5 carders e.g. AJxxx if partner not passed and have enough values / other suit tolerance
- 2 level overcalls 10+ hcp
- Responsive doubles to 3!s
- [2!c Advancer's Relay Strength Ask](#Advancer's 2C Relay) by advancer after 1!h/1!s overcall due to wide range
- [Einar cue bid](#Einar Cue Bid) by overcaller showing no good rebid or extras
- XX of major overcall is Hx+ 9+ or flat 3 card support worse ~5--8
- X by advancer is values 9+, maybe poor support
- Jump 2HS new suit is ~10â€“12 and good 6 card suit
- Jump 3x new suit is invitational and good 6 card suit
- Simple cue bids are varied in meaning, artificial - strength ask, HCR, even switch-transfer 2CD overcall
- Overcaller responding to transfers and transfer cues: complete with 2 / bad 3 cards, find another bid with less, exciting bid with more
- HCR cue is precisely invitational with support of 1x overcall
- 2N advance of 1x overcall is limit+ raise, often unbalanced
- 2N advance of 2x overcall is natural
- Switch transfers over 2CD overcalls
- Jump cue (3 level) is a mixed raise supporting a major
- Jump cue (3 level) is a splinter supporting a minor
- 3 level raise pre-emptive, below mixed raise values, definitely cooperative if responder bids
- when opponents have 2 suits and partner doubles X, cue responder is natural, cue opener cue general force
- when opponents have 2 suits a 4th position cue partner *passed* is astro 6m--4M of opener's suit, again natural of responder's suit
- when opponents bid (1 suit)--(1NT) cue is just Michaels

*** Minimum Equal Level Conversion after Takeout Doubles

- any level takeout doubles then correcting to the cheapest other suit shows a different 2 suiter and not any extras
- reasonable defensive values are required for a takeout double, not some very light overcall
- 6--4 major hands can be bid like 5--4 hands after the takeout double.
- 6 major and 4 minor will typically ignore the minor.
- minor X then ELC typically is only both majors, not a minor major
- can include the less common style with !cs and a major, correcting to a major suggesting long minor and 4 card major
- a jump in the lower suit or forcing to a higher level implies a two suiter 5--5+ that doesn't fit agreed strength ranges of the main two suiter overcalls
- concept may also apply to high level bids with limited space like 4N, e.g. (4!s)--4N, or a cue bid showing a two suiter when there are 3 unknown suits
- very strong single suiters are rare, and may need to jump cue bid or double and jump cue bid, or just bid game

*** Cue Bids and Jump Overcalls Summary

- natural single suiter overcalls are 2 level weak, 3 level weak NV, intermediate VUL
- where two suiter strengths are undefined (directly or by inference) assumed weakish (~7--11) or strong (16+), but
  consider whether just giving away information about bad breaks, the vulnerability and scoring (eg. vulnerable IMPs ~9--11 and good value placement)
- intermediate two suiter hands can use direct overcalls or takeout doubles with a later jump in the lower suit or conversion to a higher level (not equal level conversion)

**** After minor openings:

- cue of a prepared minor is natural otherwise shows a limited majors hand
- the jump one above (1!c--2!d / 1!d--2!h) over a prepared minor shows a limited majors hand
- jump cue is strong majors
- weak (3 level VUL intermediate) jumps otherwise
- 2N is unusual
- simple overcall with !s + other minor

**** After major openings:

- 2N is unusual
- cue for major + other minor
- !s cue is more specific about suit strengths and matches with the 3!c special overcall -- (!h + !d limited) OR (!h + !c strong)
- (1S)--3!c is special, a rare 2 suiter showing bid instead of single suiter jump overcall
- weak (3 level VUL intermediate) jumps otherwise

** We Open they Interfere Summary

- 2 level simple bids are natural, F1 freebids, 8+ good suit or typical 9/10+ < invite AFTER SUIT
- 1N/2x simple bids are transfers AFTER TAKEOUT
- 2 level new suit jumps are weak after suit or takeout
- jump new suit are fit jumps
- 4CD major slam tries AFTER MAJOR OPENING + JUMP PREEMPT
- Splinters of the overcalled suit or when using double jumps
- Cue bids exactly invitational HCR OR minimum game hand / limited defensive values / marginal balanced game hands, AFTER MAJOR OPENING...opponents can play undoubled, we may prefer 3N and struggle to make more than 4M
- 1m--(2!c) then Stayman/NT system on AFTER MINOR OPENING
- 3 level jump raise is Mixed (weak-limit), not trash pre-emptive (maybe bid 4 with a pure uncooperative pre-empt) AFTER SUIT
- 3 level jump raise is preemptive AFTER TAKEOUT
- 2N limit+ raise 3+ trumps, only stop if judge wasted values and minimum, implies likely to penalise opponents if we don't play the contract AFTER MAJOR OPENING, AFTER MAJOR TAKEOUT
- 2N is artificial various, except 1!d--(2!c), AFTER MINOR TAKEOUT or MINOR OVERCALL
- 1!c/1!d--(2 level jump) use the [Lebensohl scheme](#1NT Interference and Lebensohl)
- 1!c/1!d--(1N) use normal constructive [weak 1NT defence](#Opponents open 1NT) as we have no well defined suit
- 1!h/!s--(1N) 2!c is a good 8--10 raise, 2!d artificial 5--2 other major with 2 card support, 2M natural, 2N usual limit+ raise system
- Transfer bids after 1!c opening and suit O/C (not just over takeout X like 1!d!h!s openers)
- Negative doubles to 4!h
- XX after opponent's takeout double varies: *doubleton* support 6+ for a *major*, but next suit *transfer* after *minor* opening
- Support doubles by *opener* for partner's *1x major* response and *weak 2x major* response
- X/XX of cue bids of *our suit is extra length*, but *partner's suit is Stolen bid* showing

** 4th balancing of 1x openings

- same strengths
- same 2 suiter bids
- slightly more chance of 4 card suit at the 1 level, e.g. AQJ10/Axxx/xxxx/x or avoiding 1N vulnerable
- jumps are good hands (intermediate ~12--15), but again special 2 suiter bids are the same shapes
- 1N is ~11--15 (maybe 16 over 1!h/!s), use instead of a weak 4 card suit, no stopper guaranteed
- X usual takeout, but lighter ~8+ depending on shape
- 2N is natural stronger than X then NT bid, not unusual
- jump cue bid is a stopper ask
- 4x jumps are natural

Follow up responses are roughly 1 point more conservative

**** responding to 4th balancing takeout X

(1D)--P--(P)--X
    2HS = ~11--13 major jump with a 4 card suit, 5 card majors a bit weaker
    2N = natural, ~11--14
    3CD = ~10--13 minor jumps 5 cards

**** responding to 4th balancing jump bid

- new suits are forcing natural
- cue strong game try
- raise weaker limit raise
- 2N forcing

**** responding to 4th balancing 1NT

(1x)--P--(P)--1N
    2C = range ask staymanic
        2D = minimum, no major
        2HS = minimum, major
        2N = maximum
            3C = major ask again


*** Passed hand balancing

- Over (1!h) 1N is long minor + 4 !ss
- Over (1!s) 1N is !h + minor 5--5
- 2N would be 6--5 lower unbid suits

** We Open with Fit and Slam Potential then 4th Hand High Level Interference

- slam is potentially on
- we bid in 1st and 3rd then 4th hand interferes at a high level
- fit found

The primary situation is 1HS--2N, but there's other situations. In summary:

- 1HS--2N--(3x/4x) known major fit and game try plus
- 1HS--Splinter--(4x) major support splinter slam try
- 2D--4C--(3S/4x) slam try suit set

When 4th hand come in high unsupported, then always *double* = *penalty*.

**** 3 level rebid available

1H--(P)--2N--(3D)
    X = penalty
    P = minimum, no control/shortness
    3H = suit rebid, minimum often 6 cards, !d shortness
    3S = extras, cue cooperative, GF, but not above game, unknown if !d control
    4C = extras, cue cooperative, GF, but not above game, unknown if !d control
    3N = extras, !d honour control, serious 3N
    4H = better hand, !d shortness

**** 3N bid available

1H--(P)--2N--(3S)
    X = penalty
    3N = extras, !s control, serious 3N, unknown if shortage or honour control
    4CD = extras, cue cooperative, GF, but not above game, unknown if !s control
    4H = minimum, !s control
    P = no !s control

**** No 3N bid available

Pass used to show a control in the overcalled suit.

1H--(P)--2N--(4D)
    X = good values, penalty
    P = !d control implication
        X = extra strength ask (last train like), slam try
    4H = minimum, no control, assumes we will always compete to game

*** We Open Potential Game Plus Hands while 2nd and 4th Hand Compete

- we bid a *major* in 1st and 3rd with a fit and game invitational plus values
- !d opening hands not considered strong enough

Refer to [1HS--2NT Invite Plus Interference](#2NT Invite Plus Interference)

** Doubles

- Is it a standard *negative* double situation? Negative X played to 4!h (but Thrump over double jump to 3DHS). Promising the unbid major(s) or ability
  to handle the auction based on partner's next bid. Used to start a *stop ask* (Directional Asking Bid).
- Is it a standard *competitive* double situation? Competitive X played to 3!s. Double of opponents' raised suit
  when partner has opened or overcalled: 1H--(2D)--2H--(3D)--X
- Is it a standard *responsive* double situation? Responsive X played to 3!s. Partner does takeout X of Opener and
  then we X the opponents' raise (whether artificial - e.g. HCR or natural).

If these do not apply then some blanket rules exist.

Blanket rules apply up to 2!s - if not sure above 2!s assume penalty (others play this to 3!s).
*"All doubles of bids through 2!s are takeout UNLESS"*:

1. It's defined above as one of *Negative, Competitive or Responsive*
2. our side bid 1N
3. our side bid and raised a suit
4. our side redoubled
5. our side made a penalty double or penalty pass
6. the bid doubled was artificial
7. partner preempts
8. our side are in a GF (1!h/!s + 2/1, 1!c--1N/2!s)
9. our side invites 3N (1!c--2!h)
10. our side limits hand with no major (1!c--2!c/!d)


*** Takeout Doubles

Modern standard:

- happy to X with minimum when have the other major
- happy to have a doubleton in an unbid minor if we have the major(s)
- 1C/1D takeout emphasises the majors, nothing about the minors

Consider a takeout X (and maybe later DAB cue bid) instead of a 1NT bid with 4--4--3--2, the other major and the sort of hand where
partner should play NT (we have Axx they Qx)

*** Single Raise they Compete We Double

- Some play doubles below 3!s as takeout, but at best this implies an unknown side suit double fit
- Double shows extra values (possibly penalty)

1H--(1S)--2H--(2S)
    Dbl = extra values, lacking extra length
    2N = general game try, not exposing opener
    3CD = natural trial bid, exposing opener
    3H = weaker not invitational, reasonable suit/shape
    3S = GF, !s shortage, offensive hand

1HS--(P)--2HS--(2/3x)
    Dbl = penalty (see rule - we bid and raised a suit)

1HS--(P)--2HS--(X)
    XX = extra values and not just length as partner supported, forcing to 3HS or penalties
    3HS = NF

1HS--(X)--2HS--(3oM)
    Dbl = extras, penalty suggestion (see rule - we bid and raised a suit)
    3HS = NF

1HS--(any)--2HS--(3raise)
    Dbl = extras, penalty suggestion (see rule - we bid and raised a suit)
    3HS = NF

*** 2N support raise then we Double

- More likely have game on, so double is NOT penalty interest if they bid raise a suit
- Where they have no fit double remains penalty

1HS--(any)--2N--(any)
    Dbl = penalty, (see rule - we bid and raised a suit)

1HS--(2x)--(2N)--(3x)
    Dbl = extra values, shortage - SPECIAL non-penalty agreement
    4x = (below game), void


*** Delayed Takeout Doubles

When not doubling on the first round:

- X is typically long in the opponents' first bid suit
    - short in opener's second bid suit
    - short in responders bid suit when opener rebids the same suit
- decent strength, often 4 card suits competing

*** Stolen Double by advancer - Opponents' HCR double

(1H)--1S--(2S/3S)
    X = "Stolen" bid, double I would have bid that.

*** Extra Length 2 Level Double of Cuebid by Opener - Partner not bid

1H--(1S)--P--(2H)
    X = extra !h length, extra values inviting 3!h bid with Hx+ support
    3H = very good suit and shape, extras

Other examples:

- 1D--(1HS)--P--(2D)--X
- 1S--(2CDH)--P--(2S)--X

Pass then later X would allow opener to compete in the minors suits.

*** Double Showing HCR by advancer - Opponents' 3x raise

- (1x) then overcall by us then the opponents raise to (3x)
- Note, (1x)--1M--(2x) then X is values 9+ as we have space for 2N invite plus raise

X then shows a HCR.

*** Fit Jump by Opponents' then we Double - when we overcalled

(1H)--1S--(3C)
    X = !s fit and 4th suit (artificial fit showing)

When 3!c showing !cs and !h fit

*** Redouble of Negative Double - when we simple overcalled

E.g. (1!c)--1!s--(X)--XX, (1!d)--1!h--(X)--XX, (1!s)--2!d--(X)--XX

Is [advancer's 2!c relay](#Advancer's 2C Relay)

*** Extra trump redouble - we stop 2HS they takeout X

Examples:

1D--(P)--1S--(P)--2S--(P)--P--(X)
    XX = opener shows 4 card support as may have raised with only 3 cards

1D--(P)--1S--(P)--2S--(X)
    XX = responder now shows 5 cards, inviting opener to compete 3!s

1M--(P)--1N--(P)--2M--(X)
    XX = responder has 3+ card support opposite 6 cards

1M--(P)--1N--(P)--2CD--(P)--2M--(X)
    XX = opener has 6 cards

1M--(P)--2M--(X)
    XX = pointless?, 6 cards, dead minimum presumably as facing a 3 card invite

1N--(P)--2D--(P)--2H--(P)--P--(X)
    XX = opener has 3 card support

1C--(P)--1S--(P)--2S--(P)--P--(X)
    XX = 5 card weak NT hand

1C--(P)--1S--(P)--2S--(X)
    XX = responder now shows 5 cards, inviting opener to compete 3!s

1C--(P)--1H--(P)--1S--(P)--2S--(X)
    XX = opener has 5 cards

*** FSF Redouble or Other Artificial Forcing Bids

When opponents double an artificial bid for lead direction

- XX for strong play suggestion
- Pass to play if partner can help in support e.g. Hxx+
- Cannot play in the contract only doubled, must be redoubled
- Otherwise bid on as if not doubled

*** Handling doubles of our stopper ask

Helping to right side 3N or not play it.

(1S)--X--(P)--3C--(P)--3S--(X) = lead-directing X of DAB
    P = xx, Jx, or xxx in their suit
    3N = good stopper, e.g. AJx
    XX = either a full or partial stopper (Qx, Jxx)
    bid = singleton only in their suit
    4S = void in their suit

3!s cue here could be a proxy for a very strong unbalanced hand, not a DAB with something in !s, but then 3N will be pulled anyway.


*** 3N Contract Lead Directing Double

Standard meanings by the defender sitting under the declarer:

- lead my suit
- lead our suit (we both bid obvious)
- lead dummies first bid suit
- lead shortest major if not suits mentioned

** Light 4th seat Balancing bids

(OBAR) "Opponents Bid And Raise â€“ Balance In Direct Seat"

Opponents bid raise a fit below 2!s (1CDH)--(2CDH), then a 4th position bid is based
on law total tricks theory and caution depending on vulnerability, length in their suit etc.

E.g. (1H)--(2H) then bid 2!s on KQJxx/xx/J10x/xxx vulnerability dependent.


** Major Opening and Responder's 4CD Slam Try

We open 1H/1S and opponents interfere with a single or two suiter jump bid

**** One known opponent's suit  (whether showing one or two suiter)

1M--(jump)
    4C = good game raise, control in opponent's suit
        4D = some extras, Last Train like extra strength ask
    4D = major slam try without control in opponent's suit
    4M = minimal game values or moderate whilst lacking control

**** Two known opponent's suit

1M--(jump)
    4C = major slam try, shortness in lowest suit
    4D = major slam try, shortness in highest suit

** Bidding to 4CD over 3HS competition is Invitational

E.g. (1S)--2D--(2S)--3D--(3S)

- 4D in this example is a game try
- Expecting to make 4 v.s. average hand, and game v.s. good hand

Designed for IMPs, only in matchpoints might it be worth to compete to 4!d - in IMPS 3!h!s is never a great final contract
as it risks going one off or worse making a game.

** 4N is it a Stronger Raise or Unusual in Competition

- Assuming we are forced by competition to go above 4N
- The default interpretation is an Unusual 4N, e.g:

1C--(4S)--P--(P)
    X = values
    4N = 5--5 two suiter

- With a known suit from partner it could be a strong raise or unusual when forced to 5 level:

1C--(1S)--X--(4S)
    X = values
    4N = 5--5 minors or !h slam try (partner has !hs)

- Where most suits have been bid then 4N shows stronger raise of partner's suit:

1H--(2H)--3D--(4S)
    4N = good !d raise

by Responder it follows the slam bidding 4N rules

1H--(2H)--3D--(4S)--P--(P)
    4N = !d RKB

- With long strong suit for partner it should clearly be RKB:

(1S)--4H--(4S)
    4N = RKB, !hs are a known long strong suit

(1D)--4H--(4S)
    4N = RKB, yes sometimes useful to show the minors but !hs should be a strong suit

- Voluntarily going beyond game is still RKB etc.

(2H)--X--(4H)--4S--(P)
    4N = RKB by agreement

(2H)--X--(3H)--4S--(P)
    4N = RKB, clearly RKB here as responsive X available instead of 4!s if 4 card support


** Unforced Rebids Show Extra Length, Not Values

E.g. (1C)--1!s--(P)--2!h--(X)

- overcaller can pass with nothing to say
- XX shows extra values, NOT LIGHT overcall, but not want to go higher if partner is minimum 10--12
- 2S extra length

** Opener's Second Round Double - After Partner's 2 Level WJS

Double shows support and extras in shape or HCP

1D--(P)--2H--(2S)
    X = extras, support
    3H = competitive

** Opener's Renegative Double for Both Majors

1D--(2C)--X--(3C)
    X = 4 cards both majors, extras

1C--(1D)--X--(2D)
    X = 4 cards both majors, good weak NT OR prelude to forcing with strong !c hand

** Opener's Good-Bad 2N Rebid in Competition

After (2DHS) in 4th by the opposition (RHS of opener), 2N shows strong support or a weaker other suit.

1H--(P)--1N--(2S)
    2N = good-bad, assumed weak !c or !d suit in this case
    3CD = maximum, natural

1H--(P)--1S--(2C) have room at 2 level here
    2DH = natural
    2N = natural, presumably solid-ish !ds and !c stop

1H--(P)--1S--(2D)
    2N = good-bad

[Example after 1D opening](#Good-Bad 2N over 2DHS interference by 4th hand)

** Opener's Good-Bad 2N Rebid After Major NF

- 4th hand may or may not bid, e.g. 1D--(1S)--2H--(2S).
- Note double has purer takeout minors implication when X and 2N are available.

Main examples:

- 1C--(X)--2HS weak 5--7
- 1C--(1D)--2HS weak 5--7
- 1DHS--(overcall/X)--when weak jump shift
- 2C--(any)--2HS NF
- 2D--(any)--2HS NF

2N = strong support or weaker other suit
3CD = stronger natural bid
3M = competitive


** Einar Cue Bid

- catchall cue bid lacking a suitably natural rebid, minimum or maximum hands
- overcaller cue bids opener's suit at the TWO level after advancer bids (or shows somehow) a new suit e.g.
(1D)--1S--2C--2D or (1C)--1H--1S--2C.
- never too high to stop advancer rebidding their major suit at two level or minor at 3 level
- continuations natural, e.g. simple rebid by advancer 8--11, 2N ~12--14, 3M invite, new suit F1

I.e:

- (1CD)--1H--1S: 2CD cue
- (1C)--1!d--1H/1S: 2C cue
- (1H)--2!c--2!d: 2H cue
- (1S)--2!c--2!h: 2!s cue

Typically shows:

- a) minimum ~8--11(12) without natural rebid (often 5--3--3--2) OR
- b) inbetween major support, e.g. ~12 hcp with 3 card support, too good for 2M raise
- c) 13+ hcp, good hands hard to describe so generally forcing showing extra strength
- NOT a 6 card minimum two level suit rebid
- NOT a 3 level jump which shows extra values AND distributional

** Advancer's 2C Relay

- we overcall 1M and responder passes
- shows 9+ hcp, usually Hx+ to bad 3 card, often flattish
- maybe 13+ hcp catchall (semi)balanced with no support
- strength asking relay to handle the wide ~8--16 hcp overcalls.
- mostly natural (make it up) except for 2!d to show 12+
- As a 2N rebid bypasses 2M and is not artificial 12+, it conventionally shows a shapely ~10--11 6 carder, e.g. 6--4

Examples:

(1CD)--1H--2C
    2D = artificial, 12+ hcp
        2H = NF, ~9--11 Hx or real support
        2S = F1, natural (unusual given 1!s response opportunity)
        2N = GF waiting, ~12+ hcp
        cue = F1, semi-natural or just forcing
        3om = GF, 5+ minor, Hx major support, e.g. Axx Kx xxx KQ10xx
        3H = invitational, support
        3N = ~13--15 balanced
        4x = 3 card support splinter
    2H = 8--11, main suit nothing special
        2N = natural, invitational
        cue = F1, with Hx major support
    2N = F1, 10+ shapely, e.g. 6 card main suit and 4 card side suit, forcing to 3S
    3x = 8--11, 5--5
    3H = 8--11, excellent 6+ cards main suit (not mandatory with minimum)

(1CD)--1S--2C
    2D = artificial, 12+ hcp
        2H = forcing, 4 card !h suit (use transfer with 5 cards), e.g. xx KJxx AJx Axxx
        2S = NF, ~9--11 Hx or real support
        2N = GF waiting, ~12+ hcp
        cue = F1, semi-natural or just forcing
        3om = GF, 5+ minor, Hx major support, e.g. Kx Axx xxx KQ10xx
        3S = invitational, support
        3N = ~13--15 balanced
        4x = 3 card support splinter
    2H = 8--11, natural side suit
    2S = 8--11, main suit nothing special
        2N = natural, invitational
        cue = F1, with Hx major support
    2N = F1, 10+ shapely, e.g. 6 card main suit and 4 card side suit, forcing to 3S
    3x = 8--11, 5--5
    3S = 8--11, excellent 6+ cards main suit (not mandatory with minimum)


* Opponents open Strong 1C

Show majors, especially !s and bid to limit. Pass then later bid unusual NT if really want
to show !c+!d.

With limited strength may want to hide distribution information and just bid the major (not 1N / 2N overcalls).

(1C)--
    X = !s 4 cards + 5/6 card minor.
      (P)
        P = !c suit
        1D = Pass/Correct minor
          1H = 3 card !h fragment and long !c suit
          1S = 4 good !s happy with 4--3 fit
        !c/!d = pass/correct any level (unless rebid later self-sufficient suit)
        1N = 4 card !s limit raise, opening hand+
        2N = 5 card !s limit raise, opening hand+

         NT = constructive !s raise
    1D = 4--4/5--4 both majors (longer !h 5--4 is better as it will be choosen when advancer is equal length)
      !h/!s = bid to level
      1N = constructive in !h/!s, e.g. 3--3
      2C = to play
      2N = constructive game invite in !h/!s, bid 4 with max
    1HS = natural, often 5 cards
      (P)

* Opponents open 1NT

Competing over 1NT.

- Aggression is vulnerability and scoring dependent, e.g. NV matchpoints with 11+ then 4--4 majors may compete

Hand strength guide:

- Against a weak NT, we must be mostly constructive, and even more so v.s. a weak NT at IMPs (unless already passed)
- Against a weak NT, there is risk in bidding but also risk in passing, so 13--14 hcp often need to do something
- 5 card single suiter bids should have some extras in shape/strength, e.g. 5--4--3--1 shape and (12)--15 hcp
- 6 card single suiters can be a bit lighter but basically an opening bid
- The balancing position can be slightly lighter, i.e. 10+ hcp for a normal hand
- Max 7 losers, again, basically an opening hand
- Consider wasted honours and intermediate spot cards if it's a borderline maybe biddable hand, e.g. AK10xxx K10x xx xx
- The rule of 8 ( length(longest 2 suits) - LTC >= 2 then bid ) is too aggressive outside strong NT (mostly matchpoints) defence
- 5--5 two suiters may stretch to ~ 9 hcp
- Generally not balanced, including 5--3--3--2, until you have values for penalty double.
- Balancing 4--4 majors takeout maybe acceptable NV vs NV at matchpoints

* Opponents open Precision 2D

Treat as an [intermediate 2C](#Opponents open Intermediate 2C) opening, e.g. 3C is majors, with care for bad major breaks.

* Opponents open Multi 2D

- Bid naturally with decent 5--6 card suits or Strong NT hands.
- Weaker suits maybe bid on the next round
- Unlike common X showing weak NT defences this has more chance of penalising opponents.
- Double is like a takeout of a weak 2!h (assumed)
- Strong jump overcalls still, no need for major two suiter showing bids

* Opponents open 2D or 2H both Majors

Two or three choices for Ekren (chrisryall.net/bridge/weak.two/generic-defence.htm),
even possible to play the Multi 2!d defence.

- Strong jump overcalls
- Pass then double 12--14 flat
- double 15+ flat, 2--2+ majors, limited stops
- 2N 16+ flat, good stops

(2DH)--X
OR
(2DH)--P--(2!h!s)
    X = 15+ balanced not 2N quality stops, 2--2+ in !h and !s
         Further doubles (or passes) are penalty showing 4+ cards sitting over, 3+ cards sitting under.
(2DH)--P--(2!h!s)--P--(P)
    X = 12-14 balanced (pass then double)

(2DH)
    2HS = natural, sitting over 4cM hopefully
    2N = 16+, double stopped, balanced-ish

* Opponents open 2D or 2H Flannery

5!h--4!s *intermediate* (note some play 6!h--4!s or even 5!h--5!s) hands.

- Treat as weak 2!h opener with Lebensohl over takeout X
- 2N responses do not need stayman / !h transfer so use as natural weak 3!c/3!d

* Opponents open 2N Minors

- space exists to immediately separate 5--4 v.s. 4--5 major hands and to separate strengths with immediate bid
  or delayed bid (a weakness of artificial preempts)
- double strong balanced / 18+
- 3CD cue as sound takeouts with major preference
- pass then double optional for weakish takeout

(2N)

* Opponents open 2N Natural

X is majors takeout, NT is minors.

    X = takeout with decent values, inviting penalty pass

* Opponents open 3N

Whether a gambling solid/broken minor with/without side honour or a similar solid major.

Limited space, so double is rather catchall with 4CD bids special major bids:

- one bid for majors 5--4+ (with room to separate the longer suit)
- one bid for stronger major 2 suiter
- 3N double includes !d overcalls
- 4th double takeout

(3N)
    Dbl = Various
        - strong balanced (first assumed type)
        - strong 3 suited (will re-open X after escape)
        - one suited with !d
        - maybe weaker than a direct overcall of 4HS

* Opponents open 4CD SAT/Namyats

Showing good !h/!s major preempt, maybe minimum opening values.

- cue with 2 suiter
- 2nd double takeout, not showing that suit
- pass then bid with weaker distributional OR balanced hand (double)

(4C)
    P = usually weak, maybe strong NT+ if re-open double
    X = takeout of !h, normal takeout values - does not need to be that strong
