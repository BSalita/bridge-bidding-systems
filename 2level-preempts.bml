#+TITLE: 2D Three Suiter, 2H and 2S Pre-empts and Defences

* 2D Precision Style 3 Suiter

(11)12--15(16) hcp, short !d 3 suiter, 4--4--1--4, 4--4--0--5, 4--3--1--5, or 3--4--1--5

- 11 hcp 4--4--1--4 should pass
- 16 hcp 4--4--1--4 can downgrade from a 1!c opening
- Responses show strength first, then shape

* 2HS Weak Opening

** 1st/2nd

- ~7--(11), 6 card suit
- relatively constructive, no more than one Ace weaker than opening hand.
- suit quality 1 top honour, not too concerned
- extreme shape with long 4/5 card minor possible
- voids are risky (chance of other fit or bad split for opponents), maybe bid with concentrated values 3 honour suit
- beware downgrade wasted values e.g. Qx/KQxxxx/xxx/xx
- blue moon 5 card !s suit KQJ109 + side K

** 3rd/4th

- ~5--11, Undisciplined 5--4, 5--5, 6 card poor quality, possibly 4 card other major in 3rd
- ~9--11 in 4th
